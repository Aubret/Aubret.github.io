I'm interesting in developing autonomous and embodied agents that can learn without supervision. In particular, this includes self-supervised representation learning, intrinsic motivation, hierarchical reinforcement learning and open-ended learning. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Frankfurt institute of advanced studies. Below is my list of papers:
