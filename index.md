title: Deep reinforcement learning of interaction's contexts for multi-agents coordination.

## Introduction

Our goal is to use novel advances in deep reinforcement learning to improve multi-agents coordination for solving a task. More specifically, our approach is based on two steps:

1. Agents learn to recognize interaction's contexts, that is to perceive other agents and their specific nature (Agent can be heterogenous)
2. Agents learn to use this context in order to solve the task.
